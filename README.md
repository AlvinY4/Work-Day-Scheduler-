# Work Day Scheduler 
## description
This challenge we built a work day scheduler that allows the user to input and save their events for each hour of the day starting from 9am to 5pm. 
Once the time of the scheduled event has passed the slot will turn grey and the current event slot will turn red. Future events will present green.
